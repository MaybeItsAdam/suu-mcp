# SUU MCP Server

A robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for automating forms at UCL Students' Union. Built with Playwright and FastMCP.

## Features
- **Form Automation**: Record and replay form interactions (typing, clicking, file uploads).
- **Secure**: Authentication sessions are saved locally; forms are *never* automatically submitted (review mode only).
- **Robustness**: Handles retry logic for uploads, conditional fields, and session expiry.

## Installation

1. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd suu-mcp
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Install Playwright Browsers**:
   ```bash
   playwright install chromium
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Save Authentication
Run this once to log in and save your session:
```bash
python save_auth.py
```

### 2. Record a New Form
Interactive recording of a form definition:
```bash
python record_form_def.py "<url>" --id <form_id>
```

### 3. Run Manually (Test)
```bash
python run_form.py <form_id> --data <path_to_data.json>
```
